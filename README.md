# Tool Depot Supply Chain Analysis

## Project Overview
Analysis of supplier selection for Tool Depot's new hammer product line, comparing two potential suppliers across multiple cost factors and operational considerations.

## Business Problem
Tool Depot, a U.S. home improvement retailer with two stores, needed to select a supplier for their new hammer product line starting August 3, 2015. The analysis compared Supplier A ($0.80/unit) and Supplier B ($0.82/unit), considering both product and transportation costs.

## Analysis Methodology
1. Demand Forecasting
   - Used historical wrench orders as baseline
   - Applied 10% growth projection
   - Calculated total demand: 451,732 units

2. Cost Analysis
   - Product costs
   - Transportation costs (Carrier X vs Y)
   - Total cost comparison

## Key Findings
- Total cost savings with Supplier A: $7,254.64
- Carrier X (flat rate) proved more economical than Carrier Y
- Both suppliers can handle projected growth

## Tools Used
- Excel for data analysis and calculations
- Data visualization for cost comparisons
- Analytical frameworks for decision making

## Results
Selected Supplier A based on:
- Lower total cost ($365,565.60 vs $372,820.24)
- Reliable shipping through Carrier X
- Capacity to handle growth projections
